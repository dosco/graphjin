Configuration files can either be in YAML or JSON; their names are derived from the `GO_ENV` variable, for example `GO_ENV=prod` will cause the `prod.yaml` config file to be used, `GO_ENV=dev` will use the `dev.yaml`. A path to look for the config files can be specified using the `-path <folder>` command line argument.

We've tried to ensure that the config file is self-documenting and easy to work with.

```yaml

If deploying into environments like Kubernetes it's useful to be able to configure things like secrets and hosts through environment variables therefore we expose the below environment variables. This is especially useful for secrets since they are usually injected in via a secrets management framework (ie. Kubernetes Secrets).

Keep in mind any value can be overwritten using environment variables, for example `auth.jwt.public_key_type` converts to `SG_AUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE`. In short prefix `SG_`, uppercase and all `.` should changed to `_`.

#### Postgres environment variables

```bash
SG_DATABASE_HOST
SG_DATABASE_PORT
SG_DATABASE_USER
SG_DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

#### Auth environment variables

```bash
SG_AUTH_RAILS_COOKIE_SECRET_KEY_BASE
SG_AUTH_RAILS_REDIS_URL
SG_AUTH_RAILS_REDIS_PASSWORD
SG_AUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE
```

## YugabyteDB

Yugabyte is an open-source, geo-distrubuted cloud-native relational DB that scales horizontally. Super Graph works with Yugabyte right out of the box. If you think you're data needs will outgrow Postgres and you don't really want to deal with sharding then Yugabyte is the way to go. Just point Super Graph to your Yugabyte DB and everything will just work including running migrations, seeding, querying, mutations, etc.

To use Yugabyte in your local development flow just uncomment the following lines in the `docker-compose.yml` file that is part of your Super Graph app. Also remember to comment out the originl postgres `db` config.

```yaml
  # Postgres DB
  # db:
  #   image: postgres:latest
  #   ports:
  #     - "5432:5432"

  #Standard config to run a single node of Yugabyte
