GraphJin comes with a build-in GraphQL editor that only runs in development. Use it to craft your queries and copy-paste them into your app once you're ready. The editor supports auto-completion and schema documentation. This makes it super easy to craft and test your query all in one go without knowing anything about the underlying database structure.

You can even set query variables or http headers as required. To simulate an authenticated user set the http header `"X-USER-ID": 5` to the user id of the user you want to test with.
